# Data Manipulation with Pandas

Welcome to the Data Manipulation section of our Python Showcase. This part is dedicated to demonstrating the power and ease of use of Pandas, a cornerstone library in Python for data analysis and manipulation.

## Getting Started

To work with the examples in this section, you will need to have Pandas installed. If you haven't already, you can install Pandas using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

## Examples

In this section, you'll find examples that cover a range of data manipulation tasks using Pandas:

- `loading_and_viewing_data.py`: How to load data from various sources and view it.
- `data_cleaning.py`: Techniques for cleaning data, including handling missing values and filtering rows or columns.
