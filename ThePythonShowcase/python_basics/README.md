# Python Basics

Welcome to the Python Basics section of the Python Showcase project! This area is designed for those who are new to Python or programming in general. It covers fundamental concepts that are essential for understanding and working with Python.

## Topics Covered

### Variable Types

- **File**: `variable_types.py`
- **Description**: This script demonstrates the use of different data types in Python, including integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
